          <h3>Part One</h3>
          <p>Artist Ruth Asawa created face sculptures out of plaster and clay. She incorporated ordinary materials such as wire into her artwork. The use of these everyday materials is an incredible way to create art. To think she is not wasting many resources and using sand, water, and lime to make plaster is unique. It is evident in her art how she transformed these commonplace materials into captivating face sculptures, showcasing the beauty and artistry that can be found in the seemingly mundane. I think she elevated her art because of the difficult past with racial discrimination and Executive Order 9066 in 1942. She did not give up her skill of artistry and continued to study until she became and active community member, following her San Francisco public school creation. The most captivating art is the wall of faces. She uses these to catch a glimpse of the time of an individual and expresses that anyone could be a work of art. The emotional facial expressions show us that we are all the same, yet different in many ways, and all humans are art themselves, thus creators of art.

          <h3>Part Two</h3>
          <p>I had not been to this museum before, this was my first time. I think the museum could make the visitor experience a little more fun by incorpartating interactive games, puzzle, or clues throught the artwords. At the beginning, you are given a map but you would need to find your way in and out. I think one possible way would be through treasure hunt or find-waldo experiences where you would need to go through all the exhibits to find specifc art pieces. This way you walk in to all areas. The experience was still nice, I saw a lot of artwork and learned so much about Ruth Asawa, her art, school, and community. And the best part of all is that it is free to visit!</p>
