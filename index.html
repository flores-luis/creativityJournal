                    The Bible isn't merely a book to me. It is the very essence of my existence and a part of my life. 
                    I find not just words, but a lifeline to my faith in God and has been the catalyst for a remarkable transformation 
                    within me. Its wisdom has touched the deepest area of my heart and reshaped my entire life. The teachings of the Bible 
                    are a way of life, a guiding force for every decision I make. Side by side with reading scripture is prayer. 
                    It is a daily ritual that strengthens the bonds between the words of the Bible and the depths of my soul. 
                    It's in these moments of devotion that I find solace and peace. I am a Believer.
